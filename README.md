# Service Data Auditor

### Overview
This repository contains a Python tool designed to automate the auditing of customer service datasets. It reflects a "systems-thinking" approach to business analytics, moving from manual observation to automated anomaly detection.

### Features
* **Data Cleaning:** Standardizes raw inputs and removes duplicate records.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes Z-Score statistical analysis to identify service times that deviate significantly from the mean (operational inefficiencies).
* **Visualization:** Plots data distributions to reveal skewness and performance trends using Seaborn/Matplotlib.

### Context
This project demonstrates the application of algorithmic rigor to business process data, bridging the gap between raw data collection and actionable organizational insights.

### Usage
Run the analysis script:
`python analysis.py`
